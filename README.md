# Cook Render
This extension enables easy conversion of `.cook` files to `.md` files. 

To run the extension, open a `.cook` file and run the `cookrender.enableRendering` **.cook: enable rendering** command. Then any edits made to `.cook` files in the workspace will be automatically written to the `.md` file with the same name. *This means that `foo.md` will be overwritten by `foo.cook` if rendering is turned on in the workspace*.
