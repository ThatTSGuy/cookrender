# Cook Render
This extension enables easy conversion of `.cook` files to `.md` files. 

To run the extension, open a `.cook` file and run the `cookrender.enableRendering` **Enable render on save** command. Then any edits made to `.cook` files in the workspace will be written to the `.md` file with the same name. *This means that `foo.md` will be overwritten if `foo.cook` is rendered*.
